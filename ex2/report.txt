Input Space: nemployee >= 0, starttime >= 0, endtime >= 0 (nemploye, starttime, endtime in 0, ... , max_int)

Block #1: starttime > endtime (expected: readSchedule = postReadSchedule)

Block #2 endtime <= starttime, nemployee > len(workingEmployees)
        (endtime = 4, starttime = 3, nemployee = 2, len(workingEmployees) = 0) expected: readSchedule is unchanged, requiredNumber(3, 4) = 1
Block #3
        endtime <= starttime, nemployee < len(workingEmployees)
        (endtime = 4, starttime = 3, nemployee = 2, len(workingEmployees = 1))

Border Cases:

starttime = endtime
workingemployes = full
nemployes = full
nemployes = 0



next Incomplete: currentttime >= 0, currenttime < size (currenttime in 0, ..., max_int), currenttime in (min_int, ... , size - 1)

Block #1 (currenttime >= 0, size > currenttime, workingemployees (0) = requiredNumber, workingemployees(1, 2) < requiredNumber) #testar den fÃ¶rsta
currenttime = 4, size = 7

Block #2  (currenttime >= 0, size > currenttime, workingemployees (n) < requiredNumber, workingemployees(0 ... n) = requiredNumber) #testar den sista'
 currenttime = 4, size = 7

Block #3  (currenttime >= 0, size > currenttime, workingemployees (2) < requiredNumber, workingemployees(0, 1, 3, 4) < requiredNumber) #testar mitt i
currenttime = 4, size = 7

Border case:
    workingemployees full
    workingemployees empty
    currenttime = 0, size = 1
